# Quicksort and Mergesort
Performing Quick-Sort with four different pivots for partitioning
- Pivot-1: Choose the first element as pivot
- Pivot-2: Choose randomly the pivot element
- Pivot-3: Median of {First element, Middle element, Last element}
- Pivot-4: Median of {n/4 th element, middle element, 3n/4 th element}
- 
Performing Merge-Sort
Input Array types:
1. Random numbers of integers in the range 0 to 10 k ( k = 4,5,6,7)
2. Sorted array of (1)
3. Almost Sorted of (1). ( This can be obtained by swapping 1% pairs of the
sorted array)
Implementing Quick_Sort(Array, Size_of_Array, Pivot_type)
Implementing Merge_Sort(Array, Size_of_Array)
Reporting the time taken by all the four versions of Quick_Sort and Merge_sort on the input array as specified above.
