# Color set problem
A source code on C is written to create a singly circular linked list. A node consists of
• Character array to store three strings in “info” part
• Address of next node as “link” part

The following are the operations:

a) Creating five nodes dynamically in a linked list with string values as given bellow (c) in the “info” part

b) Third string value in the current node should match the first string value in the next node

c) Displaying five nodes as follows
1. blue      red      green
2. green     black    yellow
3. yellow    white    orange
4. orange    grey     violet
5. violet    brown    blue

d) Displaying only the second-string values of a linked list

e) Replacing first string values of the first and fifth node with the value “color” string and display all five nodes and also display the output as “String not matching”
