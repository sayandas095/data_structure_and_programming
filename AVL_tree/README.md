# AVL tree
Implementing Height balanced binary tree(AVL tree) in the following way(all nodes in the tree should be unique)
- providing an insert function to insert the node in the tree
- providing a delete function to delete the node from the tree(by value)
- providing a function to display pre-order,in-order,post-order, level-order tree traversal
- providing a function to calculate the sum of all nodes in the left subtree of the root node.
